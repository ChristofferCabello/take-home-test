- About how many hours did you contribute to this project?
+ About 4 Hours, on and off

- If you had time to add more features or functions, what would you consider doing?
+ I'd replace the current system of how a user is being informed about a form suceeding/failing and implement a third party library such as toastr to do event management. Additionally, I'd restructure the code to either be full tailwind or be full css, the mix of both can be confusing to read. I've already added some miscellaneous features, mostly as a fun exercise, but given the design has very specific requirements, the only touches of creativity are outside of the design. Might add a react state management to prevent valid but useless data for some of the form inputs.

- What libraries did you add if any? What are they used for?
+ tailwind for an easier css styling and to save time on finding perfect measurements for elements
+ react for basic state management of the display (though technically a part of next.js)

- Are there any limitations to your implementation? (ex: does not work in IE)
+ No real limitations, did some basic responsive test for design, but overall should work on most modern browsers as the library imported use polyfill for browser support

- Additional Notes:
+ I've added the features of allowing Canada Postal Codes and most formats of phones using inbuilt form requirements and better responsive design.
